                <h2>Luis Arranz: Hi Joris, thank you for attending me few minutes, if you want, we can start with the beginning, what made you decide to work as DJ?</h2>

                <h3>subtitulo de la nota 1, que viene de la portada</h3>

                <p>
                    Joris Voorn: You know, it was never my plan to become a professional DJ. Of course I would’ve liked to, but it was never something I thought was an option. I just started playing for fun, as a hobby and because I loved the music, though I was putting a lot of time and effort into it, I really wanted to become a very good DJ but I didn’t have so many gigs in the beginning, like most people at least back in the days. So I never thought it was going to be an option until I started making music for myself and also for hobby, you know, just because I wanted to. And then once I sent my music around, people started to appreciate it and I had some releases and that’s when I actually was able to get some gigs from for my DJ sets. And that’s when I realized, you know, that maybe there’s a future and I can professionally be DJ instead of just as a hobby. But yeah, that took a few years.
